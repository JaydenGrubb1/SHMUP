# SHMUP

## About
A very simple "Shoot 'em Up" style game with local co-op and keyboard/controller cross-play. The game is inspired by [Just Shapes & Beats](https://www.justshapesandbeats.com/) hence the code name "Neither Shaped nor Beats". The game only contains the first 30 seconds of the first level as it was just created as a proof of concept over the span of 2 days.

- Intuitive controls on various input devices
